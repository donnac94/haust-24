Summary of Question 4 and All Tasks

Introduction:
Automating or simplifying repetitive tasks is a common need in command-line environments. In this question, you're asked to create a shell script to generate a top-5 list of users who sent the most wall messages. This script will save you from having to retype a long chain of commands each time.

Goal:
Learn how to create an executable shell script that runs the necessary commands to generate the top-5 list of wall message offenders. Additionally, learn how to change file permissions to make a script executable, and how to run and modify scripts.

Tasks and Explanations:

Task 1: Review the Lecture and Slides
- Watch the lecture and review any provided materials on how to create and use shell scripts. Understanding the basics is crucial before moving on to scripting.

Task 2: Create the Shell Script File
- Command:
  nano top5wallusers.sh
- Explanation:
  - Use a text editor like nano to create a new file called top5wallusers.sh.
- Command:
  chmod u+x top5wallusers.sh
- Explanation:
  - Use chmod to give yourself execute permissions on the file. This makes the script executable.

Task 3: Write the Script
- Script Content:
  #!/bin/bash
  # This script generates a top-5 list of users who sent the most wall messages.

  grep 'user' /labs/tolh23/assignments/a2_messages.log | cut -d' ' -f9 | sort | uniq -c | sort -nr | head -n 5
- Explanation:
  - #!/bin/bash specifies that the script should be run using the Bash shell.
  - The commands inside the script are the same ones used to generate the top-5 list in previous tasks.

Task 4: Run the Script
- Command:
  ./top5wallusers.sh
- Explanation:
  - Run the script by typing ./ followed by the script name. Ensure that it outputs the correct top-5 list.

Task 5: Show Your Solution to a TA
- Once you've verified that the script works correctly, show it to a TA. They will provide you with "the secret number" once satisfied.

Extra Task: Modify the Script to Use Parameters
- Script Content:
  #!/bin/bash
  # This script generates a top-5 list of users who sent the most wall messages.

  grep 'user' "$1" | cut -d' ' -f9 | sort | uniq -c | sort -nr | head -n 5
- Explanation:
  - Modify the script to accept the log file path as a parameter ($1). This makes the script more flexible and allows it to be used with different log files.
- Command:
  ./top5wallusers.sh /labs/tolh23/assignments/a2_messages.log
- Explanation:
  - Run the modified script with the file path as a parameter to generate the top-5 list.

Key Takeaways:
- Shell scripts allow you to automate and simplify repetitive tasks.
- chmod is used to change file permissions, making a script executable.
- Parameters ($1, $2, etc.) can be passed to scripts to make them more flexible.
- Scripts can be run directly from the terminal, making them an efficient tool for repeated operations.
